# scoring-algorithms

The relationship scoring system employs a weighted multi-factor algorithm to determine connection strength between inmates and potential contacts.

Core Scoring Components (shared/src/scoring.ts):

1. Weight Distribution:
- Address sharing: 0.35
- Phone validation: 0.20
- Explicit relationships: 0.20 
- Name/city matching: 0.10
- Multi-provider validation: 0.10
- Social consistency: 0.05

2. Classification Categories:
- likely_kin: High confidence familial relationships
- possible_contact: Moderate confidence connections
- low: Insufficient signal strength

3. Validation Rules:
- Recent address sharing takes precedence
- Multiple provider verification required for high confidence scores
- Social consistency checks validate relationship patterns

The scoring pipeline aggregates signals across data sources and applies business-specific match criteria to determine final relationship confidence levels.

Business Rules:
- Address matches must be within defined timeframes
- Phone validation requires bi-directional confirmation
- Name matching incorporates familial pattern recognition
- Provider verification requires minimum threshold matches

The algorithm produces normalized confidence scores that feed into downstream bondability assessments and contact validation workflows.
